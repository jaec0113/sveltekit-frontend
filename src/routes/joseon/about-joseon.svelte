<h1>About the Joseon Dynasty</h1>

  <h2>King Names</h2>
  <div>
    <p>If you are new to learning about the Joseon dynasty keeping track of the names of the kings can be a little tricky. This is because they have a birth name, a different 'prince' name, and temple name (called 'myoho' - 묘호 in Korean), and finally a posthumous name.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Birth Name: Yi Do (이도)</li>
      <li>Prince Name: Grand Prince Chungnyeong (충녕대군)</li>
      <li>Temple Name: Sejong (세종)</li>
      <li>Posthumous Name: King Jangheon Yeongmun Yemu Inseong Myeonghyo the Great
        장헌영문예무인성명효대왕</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The most important name to know is the temple name (which is actually given to them after they die) as it how they are generally referred to. For the most part the birth name is rarely used, but can be useful to know. The prince name is slightly more important as some kings were extremely active during their 'prince' years. A good example of this would be someone like King Sejo, whose prince name was Grand Prince Suyang (수양대군). Grand Prince Suyang infamously led a coup against his nephew - King Danjong - in order to claim the throne for himself. The posthumous name is not necessary to know. Kings receive them in order to describe their reign.</p>

    <h3>'jo' vs 'jong'</h3>
    <p>
      As you read through the names of Joseon kings you will likely notice that some end in 'jo' (IE Taejo, Sejo, Jeongjo, etc.) while others end in 'jong' (IE Taejong, Sejong, Munjong, etc.). This relates to how they became king.
    </p> 
    <p>
      In a simplified way, kings that have a 'ho' that ends in 'jo' means essentially means they were not the 'natural' successor to the throne. For example, the first king of Joseon - King Taejo - did not become king by birth right, rather he took it by overthrowing the king of Goryeo. King Sejo follows a similar example as he overthrew the rightful heir in King Danjong using force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, kings that have a 'ho' that ends in 'jong' means they were the natural heir to the throne. King Munjong was the natural heir after King Sejong as he was the oldest son. Occasionally though this can be a little 'iffy' depending on how 'natural' one views certain situations. For example, King Taejong. King Taejong was not really the natural heir to King Taejo or King Jeongjong, but he still received a 'jong' ending because he was the designated crown prince and King Jeongjong voluntarily abdicated the throne. However, King Jeongjong abdicated because he feared that King Taejong (his younger brother) would come for him soon. So, was that a natural succession? Eh... technically yes, but really no. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You might have noticed that there are two kings in the Joseon dynasty that don't have 'jo' or 'jong' in their name - Yeonsangun and Gwanghaegun. These two kings were not given a king name after they died because they were both dethroned. As such they are referred to by their prince name.

  <h2>Prince Names</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of prince names, but we'll just focus on three of them.They are: 'seja' (세자), 'daegun' (대군), and 'gun' (pronounced 'goon') (군).
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important of the three is the title of 'seja' or 'wangseja' (왕세자).This title is bestowed to only one prince who is designated as the heir to the throne, and is usually translated as 'crown prince'. This is traditionally the oldest son of the king, but not always (and often wasn't). So, if you hear a prince referred to as '** seja' then he is the crown prince who will become the next king - IE 'Sado seja' (사도세자) or Crown Prince Sado.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second title is 'daegun' and is generally translated as 'grand prince'. This is probably the title you will hear and see the most on this site as it is used for the sons of the king and queen who are not designated as the crown prince. For example, take the three sons of King Taejong - Prince Yangnyeong, Prince Hyoryeong, and Prince Chungnyeong. Initially, Prince Yangnyeong, being the oldest, was given the title of Crown Prince Yangnyeong (양녕세자), but after he was kicked out of the palace he was 'demoted' to being just Grand Prince Yangnyeong (양녕대군). On the other hand, Prince Chungnyeong was originally Grand Prince Chungnyeong (충녕대군), but after his two older brothers left the palace he became Crown Prince Chungnyeong (충녕세자).
    </p>
    <p>
      The final title is 'gun' and can be translated as just 'prince'. It has several use cases, but you can simply think of it as any son in the royal family that is either A) not a son of the king and queen (IE the king and a 'consort') or B) the son of another prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reference, this site will generally just use 'prince' when referring to anyone with a prince title, and will only specify the crown prince when it is important within the context.

  <h2>The Queen, Consorts, Concubines, and Court Ladies</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      There are of course a number of titles given to the various ladies in the kings court. It was expected and normal for the king to have a number of consorts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest rank is the queen who is usually referred to as 'wangbi' (왕비). After the Gabo Reforms which saw Joseon "offiically" step out from the shadow of China the title was changed to 'wanghu' (왕후), and then after the declaration of the Empire of Korea the title changed to 'hwanghu' (황후). There are also a few titles for widowed queens as well as queens who are not married to the current king (when their king dies and their son becomes king, the current king's mother). For simplicity this site will just refer to the queen as 'queen'.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the queen were royal consorts and a wide range of royal concubines. They had their own class system that detailed the type of work they were to do during their lives at the palace. Each class rank had their own title. Consorts were given a title that ended in 'jeong' (정) or 'jong' (종). Concubines had eight different ranks. Probably the most famous royal concubine was Jang Okjeong (장옥정) who is better known by her rank name which is Jang heebin (장희빈). In this example, 'bin' (빈) is the highest rank within the royal concubine system, just below the queen and other consorts. Beneath the concubines were court ladies 'gungnyeo' (궁녀) who served a wide range of other tasks. For simplicity, this site will often by their rank when necessary or just 'lady **' if they are not the queen.

  <h2>Annals of Joseon (조선왕조실록)</h2>
  <div>
    <a href="http://sillok.history.go.kr/main/main.do">The Annals of Joseon can be viewed in their entirety here (in Korean and Chinese).</a>
    <p>
      Much of Joseon history is known thanks to the Annals of Joseon. A daily record of what the king did as well as things that happened in Joseon on that day. The Annals of Joseon are considered quite extraordinary in the amount of detail they contain and that they are highly accurate with little to no revision. Those tasked with documenting and compiling the records were guaranteed by law independence to honestly record what happened, and those who were found guilty of tampering with the records could be executed. There is a famous story that one day, King Taejong fell off his horse while hunting. King Taejong turned to the histiographer that was recording the events and requested that him falling off be omitted from the record. What did the histiographer do? He recorded that King Taejong fell off his horse AND requested that the event be omitted from the record of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name 'wangjo sillok' (왕조실록) comes from the fact that the daily recording of the king's activities was called the 'sacho' (사초), and when the king died, those records along with many others, were collected by the 'sillokcheong' (실록청) and then collated into wangjo sillok for that king to accurately detail what happened during the king's reign. The name 'wangjo sillok' is special and reserved only for Joseon kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, both Yeonsangun and Gwanghaegun, while Joseon kings, were both ousted from the throne. As such, while their reigns are documented just the same, they are not named 'Yeonsangun sillok' (연산군실록) for instance. Rather they are named 'Yeonsangun ilgi' (연산군일기, roughly translated as Yeonsangun Daily Journal). The same is true for Gwanghaegun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kings Gojong and Sunjong are also special cases. Both received the 'sillok' title, but they are not officially included as part of the Annals of Joseon. This is because the records from their reigns are not considered to be trustworthy due to the influence of Japan during King Gojong's latter years and throughout King Sunjong's. The records can be found with the rest, but again, they are set off as their own category. Additionally, most of King Sunjong's records are set off as their own appendix as they fell during the time of Japanese colonial rule.
